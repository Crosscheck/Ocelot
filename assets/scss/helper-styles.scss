// Helpers
//
// Helper classes can help remove repetition by creating a set of abstract classes that can be used over and over on
// HTML elements. Each helper class is responsible for doing one job and doing it well. Doing this will make your code
// more reusable and scalable for many features that will be added in the future. So whenever you want to create a new
// component, youâ€™ll just need to combine some classes together to build it.
